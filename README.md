1. Open and edit `index.html`.
1. Change the `<title>` of the page to "Final Exam HTML/CSS Practice 2".
1. Change the first `<h1>` of the page to "Final Exam HTML/CSS Practice 2".
1. Underneath the first `<h1>` there should be three paragraphs. However, right now only one is formatted correctly. Add `<p>` and `</p>` tags where necessary (two of each) in order to make the three paragraphs appear correctly. Remember that each paragraph should be on its own line with no empty lines between.
1. There is another `<h1>` on line 14. We want it to be smaller. Change it to `<h2>`. Don't forget to change both the opening and closing tags.
1. Go to http://lipsum.com/ and scroll down until you see the heading "Where can I get some?" Change the number of paragraphs to 4 instead of 5 and click "Generate Lorem Ipsum".
