# Final Exam HTML/CSS Practice 2

*This tutorial provides links to certain helpful documents, and on the final exam you will be free to refer to outside sources such as the Mozilla Developer Network, Khan Academy, and your own previous work if you want. I will not answer specific questions about the content, but I will tell you if you've made a mistake when you finish each section if you raise your hand and ask me to check.*

## Setup (10 points)

1. Go to https://github.com/chapelfield/final-exam-html-css-practice-2 and fork the repository.
2. Open your fork of the repository in a new tab.

## Content (80 points)

*Unless told otherwise, all instructions for this section apply to `index.html`.*

1. Open and edit `index.html`.
2. Change the page title to "Final Exam HTML/CSS Practice 2".
3. Change the first page heading to "Final Exam HTML/CSS Practice 2".
4. Underneath the first heading there should be three paragraphs. However, right now only one is formatted correctly. Add [paragraph tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) where necessary to make the three paragraphs appear correctly. Remember that each paragraph should be on its own line with no empty lines between.
5. There is a second [heading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) on line 14. We want it to be smaller. Change it to `<h2>`. Don't forget to change both the opening and closing tags.
6. Go to http://lipsum.com/ and scroll down until you see the heading "Where can I get some?" Change the number of paragraphs to 4 instead of 5 and click "Generate Lorem Ipsum".

7. Copy and paste the resulting paragraphs of Latin text into your HTML, underneath "Do You Even Latin?". Make sure to surround each [paragraph element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) with the correct tags. Remember that each paragraph should be on its own line with no empty lines between.
8. Add an [image element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) after the last paragraph and add the link to [this GIF](https://media.tenor.co/images/a27293d4c69a27cb2b258c4433ba83da/raw) in the appropriate place *inside* the `<img>` tag.
9. Commit your changes.
